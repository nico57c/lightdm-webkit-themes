# Petrichor
## A clean theme for LightDM's webkit greeter

This theme was born out of pure boredom and also out of frustration with a dull
LightDM Gtk greeter. Using another theme as a template, I swiftly gutted and
replaced 90% of it. After choosing a random wallpaper and having it
accidentally cropped by my screen size, I sprinkled users down the left hand
side and wrote a large and clear 24-hour clock in the top left. After some
feedback from [/r/unixporn][unixporn] and 3 large helpings of time for the
project to begin to mature, here we are.

A few additions and changes have been made, namely the changing of the
background, to a (derivative work of a) public domain image, and session
selection, which was missing in the initial release, has also been added.
